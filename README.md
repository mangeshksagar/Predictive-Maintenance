# Predictive-Maintenance
This repository demonstrates the steps in building a predictive maintenance solution.

## Predictive-Equipment-Failures-

* Building a predictive maintenance models to predict the probability of device failurebased sensors collected data from oil & gas industries. Which can also help to determine whether a maintenance is required to in-service equipment's by making some threshold values.

### Goal :- Prediction of downhole equipment failures using sensor data.
Following steps are required to complete this project

  * Data Acquisition
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Feature Selection
  * Resampling Techniques
  * Model Training
  * Model Evaluation
  * Model Tuning
  * Failure Probability Prediction
